# File System Interface

## File Access Methods

1. Sequential
  * ex: linked list
2. Direct Acccess
  * ex: page table
  
## Types of Directories
* Single Level
  * creates a naming problem
* Two Level 
* Tree Structure
* Acyclic Graph
  * shared subdirectoreis and files
* General Graph
  * cycles _can_ happen

## File Protection
1. Access List
  * file1: u1(r,w,x), u2(r,x)
  * file2: u2(r,w), u4(r,x)
2. Owner/Group/Everyone
  * rwx rwx rwx
  * (9 bits)
3. pwd for each file
  * file1: pwassword1
  * file2: password2

* access list is _most_ powerful

## Allocation

### Contiguous Allocation
* each file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on the disk
* wasteful of space.. prevents you from fully utilizing the space, since it can't fill small holes
* simple to use : address of block `n` = `n * block size`
  * this means it supports _direct access_
  * obviously, it also supports  _sequential access_
  
### Linked List
* allows you to break up your data and store in small holes in memory
  * does NOT support _direct access_
  * DOES supports _sequential access_

### Indexed
* uses one block as an index
  * list the indices of the different blocks allocated to file
    * they can be split up/located anywhere
    * `-1` indicates the end of the file
* supports _direct_ and _sequential access_
* takes up one extra block of space to store index (slight drawback)

<hr>

* **bit vector** stores one bit for each block
  * records a 1 or 0 for a block that is used or unused
  * allows you to quickly see how full/which blocks are full

### Unix system
* uses a combined system of multiple 'indirect' indices
* lots of pointers
* each file contains an **inode** with all the information about it
* _symbolic links_ vs. _hard links_

## File Backup
* Restore files after crash if they're backed up to a disk

### DMA
* need to have a DMA Controller (additional hardware)
  * set a counter `c` to the num of bits you want to transfer
  * decrement it with each bit
  * you know you're done when counter reaches zero
* some devices are called **block devices** that deal with data in blocks
* mice, keyboards, commands `get` and `put` are **character devices**

## I/O
* can be _blocking_ or _non-blocking_
  * non-blocking is **asynchronous**
* same concept as before

## Disk Scheduling

### FCFS
* first-come-first-served
* everything gets scheduled in the order the requests come in 

### SSTF
* shortest seek-time first
* handles the requests closest to the current position first

### Scan
* go all the way to one side (serving requests on the way)
* move sequentially back to the other side, hitting all those requests
* keep scanning back and forth, as more requests come in
* can be improved by scanning only to the last requests on either side.. not all the way to end. this is called a **look**

### C-SCAN
* like scan.. but when you hit the edge, you go all the way back to the other edge _without_ serving any requests
* only handle requests going in one direction

### C-LOOK
* similar modification to the standard look algo

## Storage
* Put backups in **stable storage**
  * need a safe place to store data
    * best way is through redundancy
      * can use up to `n` disks

# CH 18: Protection
* 'need-to-know' principle: a process can only access the resources it requires to complete its task.

## Domain-based
* rights given to groups of users through different domains
* _ring-based_ model gives most priveleges to inner ring
* _access control matrix_ puts domain on left, objects on top
  * can be implemented with a vector
    * \<domain, vector, rights-set\>
  * can be implemented with access list
  * object[i]: (domain, rights-set)
  * can be implemented with capability list
  * domain[i]: (object, rights-set)

# CH 19: Security
* Security issues are attacks from outside the system
* threats include:
  * virus
  * worm
  * trojan
  * rootkit
  * malware
* a **trap door** is a hole in the system left by the designer
* **one-way functions** can be used to encrypt an x to produce a y value... without revealing what the initial x value was
* a **one-time password** is like an auathenticator kind of thing
* f(secret, seed) function is like a random number kind of thing
* encryption is not enough to protect data, modification can still damage stuff
* **public key encryption** is very strong, almost unbreakable
  * `m^e % n = C` -> (c) -> `c^d % n = m`
  * `e` (and `d`) is the private key, known to sender (or receiver, for d)
  * `n` is the public key, known to all
* **firewall** is used to protect network from outside internet
