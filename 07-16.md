## Review

### Pipe Size
* to find out the size of a pipe, a system call `fpathconf()` can be used

### HW Notes
* use `scanf()` to check for Ctrl-D
* child-to-parent pipe: data has to _exactly_ match
* use `argc` and `argv[]` to interact with the parameters, commands and options from command line
* `execvp()` can be used to execute a command
  * command should be located in `argv[0]` (argv[0], argv)
  * elements need to be shifted back by one (and element 0 removed) to compensate for c program name as first element of `argv[]`
  * `getpid()` and `getppid()` can be used to get pid of a process or pid of parent process

## new stuff

* if 2 processes access shared memory sequentially, outcomes will behave as expected
* if they access the memory at the same time, behavior can be unexpected
* on an assembly level, the process should be this twice
  * `LD X`
  * `INC R`
  * `STORE X`
* if the order of the two processes gets mixed up, there will be errors
* this problem is really because of the _context switching_ that happens
* this creates a **race condition** when more than one process tries to access shared memory
* a **critical section** is a part of code that can only be accessed by one process at a time
* a solution to this issue is **mutual exclusion** algorithms
  * **Criteria:**
    1. No more than 1 process can be in the critical section at the same time
    2. No assumption should be made about speeds or the num of CPUs
    3. No process running outside of its critical section may block other processes
    4. No process should wait forever to enter its critical section
  * one way to accomplish this is to disable interrupts (to prevent context switch)
    * however, this is a _priveleged instruction_ that users aren't (shouldn't) be able to do
  * a _better_ way to do this is to use a **lock** (p0 shown, but imagine a similar p1)
    * `int lock = 0`
    * `test lock;`
    * `while(lock == 1);` <- potential infinite loop
    * `lock = 1;`
    * `criticalSection();`
    * `lock=0;`
      * this solution _also doesn't work!_
        * if if there's a context switch after the 'while' statement neither process will be blocked
  * another, _even better_ way to do this is to use a **token/turn** (p0 shown, but imagine a similar p1)
    * `turn = 0;`
    * `while(1) {`
      * `while(turn != 0);` <- this line can be misleading.. it catches and blocks when condition is _true_
      * `criticalSection();`
      * `turn=1;`
      * `nonCriticalSection`
    * this has the potential to block other processes from its _nonCriticalSection_ so it violates the criteria as well
  * an additional _great_ is to use **flags** (imagine a similar p1.. this is p0)
    * start with `other=0` outside of processes
    * `other=1`
    * `flag[0]=true;`
    * `while(flag[1]==true);`
    * `criticalSection();`
    * `flag[0]=false;`
    * in this example, imagine each process alternates line by line
      * if this happens, both will be stuck at the while loop
  * the _actual_ way this is done correctly is with the **Peterson Algorithm**
    * code for this and a full explanation is on wikipedia
* One way that this is done is with a **Semaphore**
  * given a semaphore `s`
  * only allows two operations to be defined on it (P and V)
  * **P(s):**
    * `while(s <= 0);`
    * `s--;`
    * this section is **atomic** meaning it must be completely executed or not at all
  * **V(s):**
    * `s++;`
  * a program's criticalSection would be wrapped by these two functions
    * `int s = 1;`
    * `P(s);`
    * `CS();`
    * `V(s);`
  * two allow for more processes to run, just change the initial value of `s`

### Barrier (Synchronization) Problems
* single and '2 out of 2' problems
  * using `P(s)` and `V(s)` how do you create certain conditions
