# slide 10.29
* program 2 only has 128 page faults as opposed to program 1 with 128^2 page faults

## Cache thrashing
* if process cannot get enough frames allocated to execute within its locality, cache thrashing will occur
  * to fix.. reduce the degree of multiprogramming AKA swap out some processes

## Chapter Questions
* **internal fragmentation:** memory can only be used by this process
* **external fragmentation:** memory can be used by other processes
* **first-fit:** allocate the _first_ hole that is big enough
* **best-fit:** allocate the _smallest_ hole that is big enough
  * must search entire list, unless list is ordered by size
  * produces the smallest leftover hole
* **worst-fit:** allocate the _largest_ hole
  * must also search entire list
  * produces the largest leftover hole
* process _rolled out_ of memory: 
  * interrupt can prevent a process from using the CPU, but still keep it in memory
* 9.5 (using external fragmentation):
  * first: no space for 426k process
  * best: fits everything
  * worst: no space for 426k process
  * note: its not always like this, sometimes worst or first could be best
* using two base/limit register sets instead of one:
  * makes it easier to split/store these two sections in memory
  * allow users to share the 'code' section (it is set to read only by default)
  * drawback is that it requires more registers aka more complex design
* why are page sizes always powers of 2^n?
  * because it maps to an address of n bits
* 9.8:
  * logical space is divided into 8 pages of 1024 words each
    * using a 4 byte word size
    * 4096 bytes = 2^12 bytes per page
    * times 8 pages means 2^12 * 2^3.. more bits... 2^15 total for address
      * 12 are used for offset (due to page size)
      * 3 used for page number (from number of pages)
  * physical memory is divided into 32 frames
    * 32 * 2^12
    * 2^5 * 2^12 = 2^17 total bits for address
      * 12 for offest
      * 5 for frame number
  * in paging scheme... page size == frame size
* 9.9:
  * only allowed to access frames that are listed in the page table (is how its implemented)
  * to allow access, swap out a page in the page table for one that you want
  * this allows you to relocate a program to a new location..
* 9.10:
  * 400 nanoseconds (since it requires 2 main memory accesses)
  * cache can be called 'associative registers' or 'translation lookaside buffer'
    * example shows 75% cache hit (25% miss)
      * .75(200) + .25(400) = 
* 9.11:
  * only need to load one copy in main memory
  * allows multiple processes to share it
* 9.13:
  * shared segmentation also possible
* 9.14:
  * easier to share a reetnrant module with seg, because
    * with segment scheme.. segment table (for process) gets a base + length register
    * with paging shceme.. need to know how many pages are going to be needed for page table
* 9.16:
  * add the offset to the base.. make sure it's under the limit (length)
* 9.18:
  * what is this stuff about keys?

# Lab 4
* optimal always generates the least number of page faults
* reference string should be randomly generated
  * max length is 30
