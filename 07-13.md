## Redirection
* standard command to run a file `./a.out`

### Input
* using some different input (from a file) `./a.out < input.txt`

### Output
* putting the output into a file `./a.out > output.txt`

### Combination
* doing both at one time `./a.out < input.txt > output.txt`

## Piping
* pipes can be used to redirect the output from a command

### Piping between Processes
* how to pipe output from grandchild process (with redirected input) into child process
  * `int fd[2]` create array to hold input (for pipe)
  * fork to create child process `pid - fork()`
  * `(if pid == 0)` AKA _if child process_
    * `pipe(fd);` create the pipe
    * `pid2 = fork();` creates grandchild process
    * `(if pid2 == 0)` if _grandchild process_
      * _first handle input redirection_
        * `n1 = open(...);`
        * `close(0);`
        * `dup(n1);`
        * `close(n1);`
      * _pipe_
        * `close(1);`
        * `dup(fd[1]);`
        * `close(fd[1]);`
        * `close(fd[2]);`
      * _execute_
    * `else if (pid2 > 0)`
      * _input needs to come from grandchild_
        * `close(0);`
        * `dup(fd[0]);`
        * `close(fd[0]);`
        * `close(fd[1]);`
      * _output goes to a file_
        * `n2 = create("output.txt", 0755);`
        * `close(1);`
        * `dup(n2);`
        * `close(n2);`
      * _execute_
  * the command to run this is `./pre < input.txt | ./sort > output.txt`
    * granchild is 'pre', child is 'sort'
    * could also be a parent/child relationship (actually simpler than this example)
* output from one process should be exactly the input to the next process (on other end of pipe)
  * if the data doesn't match, the pipe won't work, and the processes will be unable to communicate
  * use `printf` statements to debug this if it isn't working

## C Syntaxxx
* sample code is on TRACS under 'resources'
* `printf` allows you to format ouput and use wildcards
  * `%c` for characters
  * `%s` for strings (C style)
  * `%d` for integers
  * `%f` for decimals
  * can also do padding/formatting
    * `%10.5 d` for zeros + integers
    * `%.5 f` for a fixed amount of decimal places
    * `%10s` right-aligns a string in a width 10 space
      * can left-align by making the number negative `%-10s`
* `scanf` is used for reading input of specific types and assigning to vars
  * `int num`
  * `char str[10]`
  * `scanf("%d", &num);`
    * remember to include the ampersand to pass in the address
  * `scanf("%s", str);`
    * first element of an array is already a pointer, so no ampersand needed
* can use while loop to keep reading until `EOF` is encountered
  * `while ((c = getc(inf)) != EOF)`
    * `putc(c)`
* similar syntax can be used for keyboard input
  * use `c = getchar()` instead of getc()
  * pressing `ctrl-D` will send EOF and break the loop
* the function `isspace(c)` will return T/F based on if the char is whitespace or not
* similar function can be used `isalnum(c)` to test for an alphanumeric
  * `!isalnum(c)` can be used to test for special chars
* `unget()` will remove the last char read, if it was not needed (like a space)
* don't forget to add an EOF character to the end of a string `\0`
* unary/ternary `if` is allowed
* sytnax for `fgets(buf, size, stdin)` is buffer to use, size of input, and input source

### C Process stuff
* switch statement can be used instead of _if_ statements (to determine if parent/child/error/etc)
  * -1, 0, default... can all be interpreted
* `waitpid()` can be used to wait for specific child processes
  * can be used in conjunction with `WNOHANG`

### C Exit Status stuff
* status has a _high byte_ and a _low byte_
  * if high byte is equal to 4, and low byte is equal to 0 -> **normal termination**
  * if high byte is zero and low byte has a value (signal) -> **killed by signal**
  * if high byte has a signal and low byte has value -> **job control/context switching**

### Forking w/ File Data
* pointer starts at beginning of file
* if a child process picks up execution, it will continue along starting at the same point
  * problem is that they share the same pointer!
  * need to manage the position correctly

## Pipes
* a pipe has two ends
  * one for _read_ (P[0]), one for _write_ (P[1])
* to write down the pipe `write(p[1], msgVar, MSGSIZE);`
  * uses _First-In-First-Out_ order
* to read from pipe `read(p[0], inBuf, MSGSIZE)`
* technically one process can read and write to/from the same pipe
* if a process isn't going to use one end of a pipe, it should close it 
  * `close(p[0])` < - for example... closing the 'read' end (for something that is just writing to a pipe)

### Pipe Size
* to find out the size of a pipe, a system call `fpathconf()` can be used

## Signals
* if your program is expecting to receive signals, it needs to define how to react to them
* `signal(SIGINT, myFunction)` <- this is the **old version**
* `sigaction(SIGINT, &act, NULL)` <- this is the **new version**
  * this is a `struct`
    * has a field called `sa_handler` that represents the action/function to be taken upon receipt of `SIGINT`
      * this will override any default behaviors the signal may generate
      * can potentially change the order in which things are executed
      * can also be set to `SIG_IGN` to ignore signals, or switched back to `SIG_DFL` for default behavior
  * multiple signals can be handled in the same way with multiple `sigaction` calls
  * third parameter (NULL in example) can be used to save an action for example in `&oldAction`
    * `sigaction(SIGINT, &act, &oldAction)`
    * to reuse it later... `sigaction(SIGINT, &oldAction, NULL)`
* the `kill(aPID, SIGUSR1)` command is used to send a signal
  * the first param is the _pid_ of the process to get the signal
  * second param is the name of the signal that you want to send
* in child section (or wherever).. `sigaction` can be set specifically for the correct purpose
* `pause()` will tell the computer not to use CPU
  * scheduler will allocate the CPU to other processes
  * a _signal_ can be used to interrupt this and 'end' the pause
    * the next instruction to be executed would be determined by `sigaction` and the handler
    * execution then picks up after the pause
  * `sigfillset`
  * `sigdelset` <- used to remove certain signals from a set
  * `sigprocmask` <- can be used to block specific signals (especially useful during critical operations)
    * uses `SIG_SETMASK` and `SIG_UNBLOCK` in conjunction with a `&set` of signals to be blocked or unblocked
