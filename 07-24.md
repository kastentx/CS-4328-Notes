### Ch 6 cont.
* IO-bound processes use mostly IO, very low amt of CPU
* Multilevel feedback queues favor short jobs
  * RR will finish them first too
  * FCFS doesn't care at all

### Ch 8
* real life deadlocks: left-fork problem, traffic jams
* deadlock with only one process not possible.. nothing for it to be waiting on
* m resource types, with n processes
  * how to prove deadlock free?
    * break one of the 4 conditions
    * banker's algorithm <- this is more appropriate in this case
      * 1 <= Max<sub>i</sub> <= m
      * sum of all the Max<sub>i</sub>'s is less than (<) m + n
      * max column = (allocation + need) cols
      * all Alloc<sub>i</sub> + all Need<sub>i</sub> < m + n
      * if Alloc<sub>i</sub> = Max<sub>i</sub>.. you can cancel m out on both sides
      * Need<sub>i</sub> < n **(Worst Case)**
* if a process is blocked, some of the resources can be taken from it to cover for whats needed
  * deadlock CAN occur here, because of preemption (breaks condition)
  * indefinite blocking also CAN occur
* BANKING ALGORITHM
  * picture of system (12) is safe
    * to figure this out, we need to calculate the Need 'column'
      * equals the Max col - the Allocation col
    * since need col of first row was met, add the 'allocation' back to 'available'
    * next row now has the larger 'available' amt to work with
    * goal is to figure out a sequence that will allow all processes to complete
    * second part of prob (B): alloc extra to P1 and see if it works
      * this also changes need and available
      * working out the system shows that it is still OK this way
  * 4 resources, 3 process.. worst case means all resources are allocated
    * Pigeon Hole Principle proves this

### Programming / Synchronization problems
* define 'monitor' AS IT PERTAINS TO SEMAPHORE/SYNC
  * know P(s) and V(s) (semaphore)
  * monitor has more functions (and local vars)
    * monitor blocks processes by telling it to `wait` in a specific queue
    * can unblock it with SIGNAL
* "classical" problems
  * barrier problem
    * barrier can be set at a certain line
      * P and V would go right before the 'barrier' line
  * dependency problem
    * put a V operation after P0 to force P1 to wait until its done to start
      * put a P at the top of P1 (also initialize S to 0)
* REMEMBER that if there's no protection, context switch can happen at ANY time
  * this means the order that lines are getting executed can be all jumbled up
    * will always be sequential wrt to its own process though
* fork stuff related to hw1 and hw2
  * child/parent/grandchild stuff
  * create a pipe
  * how to make a connection with pipe
* scheduling algorithms
  * FCFS
  * SJF
  * pay attention to preemptive scheduling
    * higher priority process can preempt a running process


## hw
* for loop
  * (first iteration)
  * in parent, create right pipe
  * fork to create child
  * (second iteration)
  * create right pipe
  * fork to create child (c2)
  * parent assigns previous rounds pipe to this childs left pipe (inheritence)
    * l_fd[0] = r_fd[0];
    * l_fd[1] = r_fd[1];
  * `execvp` call for each child also needs a starting point (or do it the way i did it)
