## HW Due Date changed to 7/19 (midnight)
* first part has 2 programs (./pre and ./sort)
* second part has 2 programs (1 reused)
* third part has 1 program
* TOTAL of 4 differet C programs

## Semaphore
* only has two operations, P(s) and V(s)
* P(s) is atomic.. can't be interrupted
  * `while (s<=0);`
  * `s--;`
* V(s)
  * `s++;`

### Shared Memory
* has a producer and consumer
  * can not be accessed by both at the same time
* if buffer is full, block producer
* if buffer is empty, block consumer

### Readers/Writers Problem
* in this case, shared memory is a database
* readers/writers are mutually exclusive
* multiple readers allowed
* only one writer allowed at a time

### Classical solutions
* reader/writer processes (mutex)
  * manage the reader/writer processes
  * keeping a count will prevent read-before-write
* `signaled` flag indicates a writer is in the db
* each reader unblocks the next reader process in the line
* in this style, the writers can starve a reader process

#### bonus question
* is there a solution in which readers/writers don't starve each other?
  * AKA 'fair' solution
  * make sure the 3 basic requirements are satisfied
* **10 pts extra**

### Dining Philospher Problem
* philosophers have certain states
  * thinking, hungry, eating
* imagine philosophers sitting around a table
* 1 fork in between each of them
* they need 2 forks to eat
* sample code on TRACS shows some good+bad solutions to this
* the problem we are facing here is _shared resources_
  * context switching is the problem in the first example
  * no way to gaurantee the 2 'take fork' instructions will be atomic
  * if all the philosophers grab their left forks, there will be no forks available to be grabbed as the 'right' fork.. and no one will be able to eat
  * this is called a **deadlock**
* solve this by making the "take forks" step atomic
  * do this with a function that uses **mutex** (P and V)
* also a 'test' function is introduced
  * this checks the state of neighboring philosophers to get fork availability

* /2 or (/2) -1

### recap semaphores
* barrier prob
* sequence prob
* classical prob

## Monitor
* an alternative to semaphore method
  * they can be used to solve the same type of probs
* monitor M contains some hidden data
* many functions can be defined on it
* multiple q's can also be defined
* processes are blocked by using `wait()`
  * specify a q, like `wait(q2)`
* unblock with `signal()`
  * q specified here as well, like `signal(q2)`

### producer/consumer using Monitor Method
* two main functions
  * producer uses `pc.enter()`
    * if `count == n`, use `wait(full)`
      * `full` is a previously defined `q`
    * else, allow producer to enter an item
      * inc count by 1
    * if `count > 0` use `signal(empty)` to reactivate consumer
      * _more accurately_ we only need to do this when `count == 1`
  * consumer uses `pc.remove()`
    * if `count == 0` use `wait(empty)`
      * `empty` is a previously defined `q`
    * else, allow consumer to remove an item
      * dec count by 1
    * if `count < n` use `signal(full)` to reactivate producer
      * _more accurately_ we only need to do this when `count == n-1`

### readers/writers using Monitor method
