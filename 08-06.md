# Ch1 8
* 18.9 & 18.10
  * use a counter
* 18.11
  * need-to-know: process can only access resources that its been allocated (that it needs)
* 19.1
  * keeeping a log will help you keep track of unauthorized logins
* 19.2
  * encrypt the passwords so they aren't in plaintxt
* 19.4
  * what if the protection software is infected? <- potential hazard
  * frequent updates (from remote server) helps to minimize this
* 19.5
  * using a firewall will help protect against worms/threats online
  * drawbacks of a system like this are that they are slower
    * packet has to be inspected before it goes through
* 19.6
  * encrypting data will make things more secure (obviously)

#### Final exam is Thursday at 11 AM
#### HW 4
* you can have user select the number of frames
  * randomly generate the frames themselves (1 - 5)
* never a tie for LRU
* there can be tie (near the end) with Optimal
* print out page replacement step-by-step
  * indicate when page faults happen
* compare the number of page faults with both algo's

# Review
## Memory Management 
* this part is the main thing
* 10.11
  * remember 'frames' are in main memory
  * each page gets loaded in from the disk for the first reference
  * then, each algo differs in how the new ones come in
  * optimal: look into the future, see what you won't need
  * LRU: look in the past.. what hasn't been used for longest amt of time
  * second chance: circular linked list... reference bit for each entry
    * set to 1 when page is loaded
    * when removing: change bit to zero and move on.. only remove an entry when the ref bit is zero
  * **ADDRESS CONVERSION**
## paging
* logical address gets divided into pages (or segments) for each process/program
* physical (main) memory gets divided into frames
* page table is the mapping in the middle
  * page# index, frame# value, has a valid/invalid bit
  * one page table per process
  * stored in main memory for fast access time
* pages/segments are loaded into the memory/frames
* 'demand paging' uses dynamic loading to only load in the data needed
### IPT (Inverted Page Table) 
* frame# is the index, value is the page#
* goes _from_ physical address and gives you the logical address (opposite dir of normal)
  * also needs to have a `pid` column to keep track of which process the page belongs to
* there is only one IPT regardless of the number of processes (also has a fixed size)
### addressing
* normal logical address has page# and offset
  * needs a pid as well in an IPT
* normal physical address has frame# and offset
* if the logical space is 2^m bytes, the address is m bits
* if each page is 2^n bytes, the offset is n bits, and the page# is m-n
* convert the size of the space into powers of two
### EAT algorithm
* access time for hits/misses with certain conditions
* construct an equation
* hit% * (some stuff) * miss% * (some stuff)
* Translation Lookaside Buffer aka Associative Registers are other names for cache
* hit would include time to go to the TLB, which would send you straight to the frame
* miss would invlude that time, plus the time to go to the page table (main memory)and then load data
* multi-level paging would use multiple page tables (each with their own memory access times) to produce the frame number
* both n-level paging scheme and IPT are efforts to reduce page table size
  * this helps keep the address small
## segmentation
* the only difference with segmentation is that the segments can have different sizes
  * as opposed to pages, which are all the same size
* the segments are split up based on logical parts of the program
* base and limit (or length) will tell you the size of each segment
* ST - segment table
  * index is the segment#, 2 values: base, and limit
  * to see if an address is valid for a segment, see if it is less than base+limit
* cutting stuff up helps to maximize efficient use of the memory

## partitioning
* first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit
  * think about how memory would be allocated to a process if each of these 3 algorithms were used
* leftover space in a partition is called 'fragmentation'
  * can be internal/external

## seconday storage
### disk management scheme
* 'blocks' are the unit of allocation for new files on the disk
* a file may need more than one block of space
  * three schemes for storing these:
    * contiguous
      * hard to fit
      * supports direct and sequential
      * no waste
    * linked
      * does not support direct access (only sequential)
      * small waste of last byte in each block (pointer to next block)
    * indexed
      * uses one block for an 'index file'
      * supports direct and sequential access
* 'bit vector' is a string of 1's and 0's indicating whether each block is full/empty

## Disk Scheduling
* head has to move back and forth accross the disk
* if scheduling is not good, there will be a lot of wasted time/movement
* idea is to make it as efficient as possible
* 6 algo's to do this
  * First-Come-First-Serve
    * Fair
  * Shortest-Seek-Time-First
    * serve the request that is closest to current position
  * SCAN
    * chose a direction and go all the way to that edge
      * (serving requests on the way)
    * go to the other edge
      * serve on the way
  * C-SCAN
    * go to first edge without serving any requests
    * then like scan
  * LOOK
    * like SCAN, but don't touch the edge
    * only go as far as the last request on either side
  * C-LOOK
    * same modification as C-SCAN (only serve requests going in one direction)

## newer stuff
* need-to-know principle
* domain, object, access rights
* ring, access list

* passwords/security needed to protect from outside attackers
* one-way function means its easy to output if you have input, but you can't reverse-engineer it easily
* firewall is like a filter to check each packet going in/out from the outside internet
