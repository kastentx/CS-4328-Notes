* 9.10
  * memory will have to be accessed twice.. (total 400ms)
    * once to read the page table (200ms)
    * once to get the frame listed in the table (200ms)
  * part B uses `EAT` algorithm
    * .75(0 + 200ms) + .25(0 + 200 + 200ms)
    * remember.. for n-level paging schemes the (one 200ms) memory access is multiplied by n
* 9.5
  * first-fit: 426k block won't fit
  * others not done in class..
  * remember - internal fragmentation _can't_ be used by other processes
  * external fragmentation can be used by other processes
  * "best fit" ends up being the most efficient, since it is the only one that can fit all processes

  * virtual address = logical address (page or segment)
  * physical address (frame AKA main memory)
* 9.8
  * paging scheme / address translation
  * from logical to physical..
  * 1024 words in each 'logical space' AKA page (8 of them)
    * 8 pages is 2^3, so 'page #' portion of address is 3 bits
  * words are 4 bytes.. so 2^3 * 2^10 * 2^2 = 2^15 bytes in total logical space
    * this means 15 bits total in the address
      * 3 for page, 12 for offset
  * physical memory has 32 frames (ALWAYS the same size as pages)
    * 32 * 1024 wors = 2^17 bytes for physical address
      * 12 bits for offset (same), 5 bits for frame# (2^5 = 32)
* 10.3 (picked by prof)
  * first convert address from hex to binary.. 
    * each char in hex maps to 4 bits in binary
  * 2^32 bytes in virtual space -> 32 bits in address
  * 2^18 bytes in physical space -> 18 bits in address
  * 4096 bytes in page (2^12) so 12 bits for offset (same for both)

* Don't forget about the disk-scheduling algorithms
* conceptual questions about security
  * passwords, firewalls..
* most of the questions will be focused on the memory management
